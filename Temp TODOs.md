Task list for weeks 4-5-6:  Use feedback to make edit to first notebook 

- [ ] Be thinking about when it may make sense to go beyond simulator and use the actual quantum resources at IBM 
- [ ] Be thinking how these algorithms relate to post quantum cryptography (for example, shaw can break RSA)
  - Contest to identify quantum proof algorithms 
- [ ] Describe and Implement simple quantum algorithm (treat like making a tutorial)  
- [ ] Summarizing grover and shor (next steps are implement)  
- [ ] Goal to have done for our meeting in week 4:  Use feedback to make edit to first notebook 
- [ ] Describe and Implement simple quantum algorithm (treat like making a tutorial)
